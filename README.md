simpleGWTShowCaseClone
======================

A small and basic clone of GWT for deliberately awkward automation examples.

This is a small and basic clone of a GWT examples site to support learning automated testing on an app that is deliberately hard to automate, but is also very small and easy to deploy.

I usually run it locally using the simple webserver from http://www.jibble.org/miniwebserver/
